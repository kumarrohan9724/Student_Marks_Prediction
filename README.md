# Student Marks Prediction using Study Hours

This project aims to create a predictive model for student marks based on study hours. The analysis involves utilizing google collab(generated using Colaboratory) that covers various stages of the data science pipeline.

## Overview

The notebook within this repository walks through the following steps:

- **Data Loading:** Loading the dataset containing student marks and study hours.
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, or any inconsistencies.
- **Data Visualization:** Exploring the relationship between study hours and student marks through visualizations.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implementing a Linear Regression algorithm to predict student marks based on study hours.

## Files Included

- `student_marks_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis.
- `dataset.csv`: Dataset used for analysis (if applicable).

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook locally or in your own environment, you'll need:
- Python (along with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (for running the notebook)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-marks-prediction.git
    ```

2. Open the `student_marks_prediction.ipynb` file in google collab.

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to understand the analysis and run the code cells.

## Example Results

The model trained on the provided dataset achieved an accuracy of XX% in predicting student marks based on study hours. Results and insights from the analysis are further detailed within the notebook.
